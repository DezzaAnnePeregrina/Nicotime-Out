# Nicotime-Out

This repository contains the code for my undergraduate thesis, "Nicotime-Out: A Mobile Application to Overcome Cigarette Addiction." The application is developed for Android using Java and Android Studio. The backend of the application is implemented using SQLite, and the design and animation were created using Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop, and Filmora. This application aims to assist users in overcoming their cigarette addiction through various features and tools.
