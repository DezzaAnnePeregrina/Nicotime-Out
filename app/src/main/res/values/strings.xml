        <item>“What makes the desert beautiful is that somewhere it hides a well.”</item>
        <item>“All the suffering, stress, and addiction comes from not realizing you already are what you are looking for.”</item>
        <item>“People spend a lifetime searching for happiness; looking for peace. They chase idle dreams, addictions, religions, even other people, hoping to fill the emptiness that plagues them. The irony is the only place they ever needed to search was within.”</item>

        <item>“Man never made any material as resilient as the human spirit.”</item>
        <item>“You can come out of the furnace of trouble two ways: if you let it consume you, you come out a cinder; but there is a kind of metal which refuses to be consumed, and comes out a star.”</item>
        <item>“I have learned over the years that when one’s mind is made up, this diminishes fear.”</item>
        <item>“Hardships often prepare ordinary people for an extraordinary destiny.”</item>
        <item>“Sometimes we motivate ourselves by thinking of what we want to become. Sometimes we motivate ourselves by thinking about who we don’t ever want to be again.”</item>
        <item>“When we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways – either by losing hope and falling into self-destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength. Thanks to the teachings of Buddha, I have been able to take this second way.”</item>
        <item>“Cause sometimes you just feel tired. Feel weak, and when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up. But you gotta search within you. You gotta find that inner strength. And just pull it out of you, and get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.”</item>
        <item>“Life is not easy for any of us. But what of that? We must have perseverance and, above all, confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for
something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.”</item>
        <item>“Life has many ways of testing a person’s will, either by having nothing happen at all or by having everything happen all at once.”</item>

        <item>“I dwell in possibility.”</item>
        <item>“Don’t let the past steal your present.”</item>

        <item>“Not feeling is no replacement for reality. Your problems today are still your problems tomorrow.”</item>
